# Dandy

Programming for anyone not interested in computers.

# Install

Dependencies are Elm and Perl

# Usage

To build the website `make`

To build the course `./build-course.pl python.md`

# Direction

We're looking for simple ways for people to get started with programming. The first step should be some sort of puzzle solving. To do this, look at the research that's happened before us. Alan Kay and Seymour Papert are both well known here.

## Learning Goals

The only point of learning is if it helps you achieve what you want to do. Ideas for those goals.

* puzzle solving
* games (game makeer)
* music
* animations
* programming for its own sake

What appeals to girls and not just boys?

## [Logo](https://turtleacademy.com/learn.php)

Logo is a very simple programming language. It allows you to move a turtle around on the screen to draw shapes. And combine those movements into functions.

## [Blockly](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/)

Blockly is the bases for [code.org](https://studio.code.org/) as well as [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). It is a simple procedural block programming language. Blockly also supports compiling to Javascript, Python, Lua and other languages. [Blockly Source](https://developers.google.com/blockly/)

## [Flow Based Programming](http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/)

[Wonder](https://www.makewonder.com/) appears to be the best example of flow programming used to teach children.

FBP as a whole has been around for a long time but largely remains unexplored. Lately it's gathered some interest in the Javascript community (such as [NoFlo](http://noflojs.org/))

## [Alice](http://www.alice.org/index.php)

I know very little about this project. Though it inspired [quorom](https://quorumlanguage.com/) a small degree.

## [CodeCademy](https://codecademy.com/)

Assumes you already want to learn to program. Teaches you the syntax and slowly symantics on many languages. Doesn't explain "why?"
