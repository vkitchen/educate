Welcome. I take it you're here to learn to program? To start off with I have prepared an example for you.

See what it does, and if you're upto it change what's between the "quotes" so that it greats you instead of the world.

    :::python
    print "Hello, World!"

    :::python

Computer programs are written step by step. A new instruction on each line. Almost like poetry.

Can you finish this one off for me? I'm never very good at them

    :::python
    print "there once was a village"
    print "and in that village lived..."

    :::python

That's a really cool poem, but wouldn't it be cool if we could make it interactive? That'll show Shakespeare

    :::python
    print "I want to tell you a story"
    print "But first can you answer this quiz"
    name = input("What is your name?")
    age = input("How old are you?")
    print "Hello " + name + " aged " + age

    :::python
